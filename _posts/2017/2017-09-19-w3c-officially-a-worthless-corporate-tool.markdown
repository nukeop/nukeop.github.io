[W3C officially recommends DRM as a HTML5 "standard"][9134a90d]

Meanwhile, [EFF resigns from W3C][be9f695c] for this outrageous betrayal of everything that is good, respectable, and wholesome on the internet. Let the corruptible maggots from W3C rot in hell. They're now officially nothing but yet another piece of the puzzle that is the corporate overtake of the internet and its surrounding infrastructure. Hopefully [GNUnet][8970c661] will be mature enough before the internet as a whole succumbs to corporate influences and sinks completely.
